## 😫 Pain Points Section

### Section Headline
```
Are You the CEO, CFO, COO... and Janitor?
```

### Pain Point Cards

**Pain Point 1: Strategic vs. Tactical**
```
💼 Making Million-Dollar Decisions Between Email Responses?

You're capable of 10x growth strategies, but you're stuck scheduling meetings, 
chasing invoices, and putting out daily fires. Your genius is being wasted 
on tasks any assistant could handle.
```

**Pain Point 2: Time Scarcity**
```
⏰ Working 70 Hours But Growing at 7% Rate?

The harder you work, the busier you get – but revenue stays flat. You're 
sprinting in place while competitors with clear focus are pulling ahead. 
Something's got to give.
```

**Pain Point 3: Decision Fatigue**
```
🧠 Drowning in Decisions That Don't Drive Growth?

By 2 PM, you've made 100 micro-decisions and have zero mental energy left 
for the strategic thinking that actually matters. Decision fatigue is 
killing your edge.
```

**Pain Point 4: Isolation**
```
🏝️ No Executive Team to Bounce Ideas Off?

Every strategic decision lands on your desk alone. No chief of staff to filter 
priorities. No executive team to stress-test ideas. Just you, a mountain of 
tasks, and the weight of every choice.
```

### Pain Points List Format
```
Solo CEO Reality Check:
✗ Checking email 50+ times per day while strategy suffers
✗ Attending meetings that could have been emails (or eliminated entirely)
✗ Manually tracking metrics instead of seeing automated insights
✗ Making gut decisions without data because "there's no time to analyze"
✗ Working weekends to catch up on the work that actually matters
✗ Feeling like you're building a job, not a business
```
